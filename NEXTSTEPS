-- Profile/Account Page --

Working on the edit profile page.

I want it to display a different form to edit the User object based on the user role

In the route, I will use a conditional to test the current_user.role and return a different form dependent
on the value in curent_user.role .


-- Admin Page --

Create an admin login Page
